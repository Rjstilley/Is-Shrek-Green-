Project 2- Color Blindness by colors

Why did we choose this topic?
The team shared interest in learning more about color blindness due to one of our team members being personally affected by color blindness. We want to look at different correlations regarding color blindness using data from the Mayo Clinic, NIH, and wikipedia. Our datasets contain color blindness data from the years 2000 through 2010. Some of the correlations that we want to look at, and visually display include: 

Color blindness by color
Color blindness by gender
Color blindness by generation
Color blindness by intensity
Color blindness by race/ethnicity
Color blindness by state
Color blindness by age
Color blindness by cause

We would also like to include a section or sections on our webpage that explore adaptability, testing, and resources for people with color blindness.
